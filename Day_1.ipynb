        "\n",
        "1. all programming should be done in English. This helps people understand stuff and also while googling for errors\n",

        "My idea is to introduce the basic concepts of the language, but what I really want you to learn is two things:\n",
        "1. divide problems into smaller subproblems until you can solve them. That's what I think is the most useful think about programming in general life\n",
        "2. learn how to use google to solve every problem\n",
        "\n",
        "That's why I'll try to explain only a tiny bit and then show how you can find the rest yourself.\n",
        "\n",
        "a few disclaimers:\n",
        " - it might be a bit difficult in the beginning, but trust me, once you've mastered the basics you'll get creative in what you can do.\n",
        " - from my experience it's sometimes a bit confusing to hear all the new terms, I'll try to minimize that as much as possible but it cannot be avoided at all.\n",
        " -  if you're thinking *hmm I kinda get it but I don't see why we're doing all this* then that's perfectly fine, you normally have this feeling until you know enough to have your own ideas."
